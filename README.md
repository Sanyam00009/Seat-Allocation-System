# Seat-Allocation-System
 I created a seat allocation system using Java and the simulated annealing algorithm for optimal seating arrangements. Machine learning was used for predictive analysis, and HTML was employed to design a user-friendly interface. This project integrated advanced algorithms and web development for an efficient solution.
